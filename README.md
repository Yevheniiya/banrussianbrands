Every transaction in a hostile business is support for the enemy, sponsorship of the war. Russian businesses often mimic European ones and are difficult to identify. To do this, I am working on a bot that publishes information about the origin of the brand and its relationship with Russia.

The bot has a simple control: after launching in a telegram, all you need to do is send it the name of the brand and it will give information about the origin, holding and status (green red or indeterminate).

There are very few brands in the bot database at the moment, but we are working on it. Later, the bot will be deployed and available by the @banrussianbrandsbot tag in the telegram.
